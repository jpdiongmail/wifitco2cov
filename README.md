the processor XIAO ESP32C3 from seed studio, powered by a phtovoltaic cell
with a battery, gets the values and send them via wifi to a smartphone.
The XIAO code is in C language and is developped with the Arduino IDE.
The smartphone code is developped with the App Inventor from MIT which
provides a designer and graphic code blocks :  https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/designer-blocks
